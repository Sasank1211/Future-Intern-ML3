🛠️ Software Tech Support Chatbot

A smart, automated Technical Support Chatbot designed to assist users with common software issues such as installation errors, system troubleshooting, connectivity problems, login issues, performance optimization, and general technical queries.
This chatbot uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and rule-based or ML-based logic (depending on your implementation) to deliver fast, helpful, and accessible support.

📌 Project Overview

The Software Tech Support Chatbot is built to provide users instant answers to software-related problems without needing a human agent.
It acts as a virtual assistant that can:

Diagnose common software issues

Guide users through troubleshooting steps

Provide FAQs and step-by-step solutions

Offer recommendations based on the user's problem

Reduce support workload and improve response time

🎯 Key Features

✔ AI-powered user query understanding
✔ Responds to common technical issues
✔ Handles multiple problem categories
✔ Provides step-by-step troubleshooting
✔ Can integrate with websites or applications
✔ Customizable knowledge base
✔ Fast and scalable response system

🧠 Technologies Used

Depending on your implementation, the chatbot may use:

Python

NLTK / spaCy / Transformer models

Flask / FastAPI for deployment

Scikit-learn / TensorFlow (if ML model used)

HTML/CSS/JS for frontend integration

JSON or database for storing FAQs and responses

🚀 How It Works

User enters a technical problem (e.g., "My software is not opening", "Login failed").

The chatbot applies text preprocessing and intent classification.

It identifies the category (Installation, Updates, Errors, Connectivity, etc.).

The bot retrieves the best response or troubleshooting steps.

User receives the solution instantly.
